# New-Workshop-2

For this task I downloaded VSCode and created a sketch using setTimeout and setInterval functions, I used setInterval for the squares and setTimeout for the tiangles in this sketch. I could have improved this sketch by making the triangles have sides of equal length, which would look better visually with the squares.

I also experimented with a new shape from the p5.js documentation, which was a circle with a moving mouth.
